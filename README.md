# Description

This Challenge used REACT for the students to build and deploy their own portfolios to introduce themselves and show their class work.  
I'm a student at University of California Berkeley Extension Bootcamp, and am taking Full Stack Web Development class, and am expecting to complete the course on January 30, 2025. I love web development as the Internet powers the world's prosperity. It is amazing to me how the code works can create meaningful and useful websites that everyone can easily to get access to it. 

# Usage

This challenge features navigation of 4 sections, "About", 'Portfolio", "Contact", "Resume". 
Each section contains its respective contents. 
For the user to invoke the challenge, in the terminal type the followings:
  npm run build
  npm start  

# Installation

   In the root directory, type 
   npm run install  // This will do cd client npm i && cd server npm i .
   npm start

# React + Vite
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
Currently, two official plugins are available:
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Questions

When the GitHub profile (https://github.com/ksytwu100) is provided, that is added to the section entitled Questions. The challenge was built with my understanding of the required materials by attending classes, BCS tutoring sessions, Google searches, and attending office hours for the solutions to my questions.
