        I am a bootcamp student at the University of California Berkeley Extension taking a Full Stack Web Development course. 
        As we are aware the dominance of mobile internet is where users can search the interest at any time worldwide no matter
        where they are. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows business to increase their visibility and find the right customers
        for your business. The presence of the Internet benefits and powers our education, economy, health and well-being. And it
        connects us to our friends and to those we love. I want to become a full stack web developer.
